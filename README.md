# Project Introduction

In this project, you'll use your skills with Spring Boot, APIs, documentation and testing to implement a Vehicles API that serves as an endpoint to track vehicle inventory. While the primary Vehicles API will perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) related to vehicle details like make, model, color, etc., it will need to consume data from other APIs as well regarding location and pricing data. You will implement a RESTful API for the Vehicles API, as well as converting a Pricing Service API to a microservice.

By the end of this project, you'll have an application that can communicate with other services and be able to be viewed and used through Swagger-based API documentation.
